# InclusiveAI at AI NI Datathon for SmashFly's Challenge

We developed a Machine Learning pipeline to analise data bias in recruiting and developed Computer Vision technology to remove human & machine inherent biases in recruiting and pre-screening processes.

## Motivation

## Notebooks

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](src/notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb): EDA by looking at all the fields and their values
2. Data Wrangling: Data Clearning & Conversion 
3. Data Summarization:
   * [Correlations & Scatter plots](src/notebooks/3.%20Correlations%20%26%20Scatter%20plots.ipynb)
   * Data Distributions
4. [Feature Engineering](src/notebooks/4.%20Features.ipynb): handcraft a bunch of features from the fields
5. Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, tSNE, UMAP
6. [Split the data](src/notebooks/6.%20Split%20Train%20and%20Val%20sets.ipynb): split the dataset into Train and Validation sets
7. [Modelling a classification model](src/notebooks/7.%20Modelling.ipynb):
   * Model a Random Forest classifier and analyse the power of their features
8. Ablation studies: fitting a Linear Regression model and running ablation studies to measure the variance explained by the features
9. Mutual Information Exploration: measuring the mutual information (mutual dependence between two variables) of each of the features we figured as important (based on the ablation study) and the precision mark.
10. Hyper-parameter tuning: tune the model
11. Train the final model: train the final model and build the submission file
